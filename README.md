# DeCrappifyingFaces

Solved this as a take home assignment for an interview. I was given a subset of the celebrity dataset which had ground truth as the original images of the celebrities and the input as a 'crappified' version of these images. The crappification was done by the interviewers using a mix of motion blur and a random dropout with a low probability.
